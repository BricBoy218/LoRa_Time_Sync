# LoRa_Time_Sync
This repository contains all of the code used for my final year project which was to develop a system for synchronising the time of IoT nodes using LoRa.

Time synchronicity between nodes is essential in a IoT network that collects time sensitive data, and a desynchronization will cause the network to collect skewed data. A desynchronisation can be caused by clock drift or a loss of power to a node. This project was done with the intention of complementing research being done by a PhD student in the POT research group in the School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering at TU Dublin. The system developed and discussed in this report can reliably synchronise a LoRa network of nodes and can detect and mitigate the desynchronisation of a node to avoid skewed data being reported by the network. The system also can be used to identify a period of desynchronization and the data collected during that period can then be processed accordingly. The system mitigates the issues related to time desynchronization in an IoT LoRa network.
